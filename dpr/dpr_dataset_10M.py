    # The dataset was generated using text snippets from the files in the "en" (305GB) variant of the C4 dataset

    # We used files c4-train.00000-of-01024.json.gz and c4-train.00001-of-01024.json.gz in the train folder (c4/en/train)
    # to generate the base vectors, and file c4-validation.00000-of-00008.json in the validation folder
    # (c4/en/validation/) to generate the queries.
    #
    # The output .fvecs file with the generated embeddings is located at {dataset_dir}/embeddings and the filename
    # is given by: {fname_prefix_out}_queries_{int(num_embd / 1000)}k_files{init_file}_{init_file+number_of_files}.fvecs
