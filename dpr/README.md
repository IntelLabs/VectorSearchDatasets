# DPR Dataset Generator

This repository provides code to generate base and query vector datasets for similarity search benchmarking and evaluation on high-dimensional vectors stemming from large language models.
With the dense passage retriever (DPR) [[1]](#1), we encode text snippets from the C4 dataset [[2]](#2) to generate 768-dimensional vectors:
- context DPR embeddings for the base set and
- question DPR embeddings for the query set.

The metric for similarity search is inner product [[1]](#1). 

The number of base and query embedding vectors is parametrizable.

## DPR10M

A specific instance with 10 million base vectors and 10,000 query vectors is introduced in [[3]](#3). Use the script [dpr_dataset_10M.py](dpr_dataset_10M.py) to generate this dataset. The corresponding ground-truth (available [here](gtruth_dpr10M_innerProduct.ivecs)) is generated conducting an exhaustive search with the inner product 
metric.

Here is a summary of the **steps to generate this dataset**:

1. **Download the files** corresponding to the `en` variant of the C4 dataset accesible [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/c4). 
The complete set of files requires 350GB of storage, so you might want to follow the instructions to download only a subset. For example, to generate 10M embeddings
we used the first 2 files from the train set (i.e., files `c4-train.00000-of-01024.json.gz` and `c4-train.00001-of-01024.json.gz` in `c4/en/train`).
   
2. **Execute** the `generate_dpr_embeddings` function to generate a `.fvecs` file containing the new embeddings. 
   Note that different settings should be used to generate the **base vectors** and the **query set**, as they use the 
   DPR context and query encoders respectively. 
   See the script [dpr_dataset_10M.py](dpr_dataset_10M.py) for details.

# Example code to generate base vectors

from dpr_dataset_generate import generate_dpr_embeddings

base_C4_folder = '/home/username/research/datasets/c4/en'  # Set this path to where your c4/en folder is located
cache_folder = f'/home/username/.cache/huggingface/datasets/'  # Set to the hugginface datasets cache path
dataset_dir = f'{base_C4_folder}/train/'

num_embd = 10000000
init_file = 0
num_of_files = 2  # Make sure the input files (2 in this case) are enough to generate the 
                  # requested number  of embeddings. 
                  # To get an estimate, use the optional parameter get_total_embeddings_only 
                  # to get the number of embeddings that can be generated from a certain 
                  # group of files without actually generating the embeddings.
fname_prefix_out = 'c4-en'
doc_stride = 32
max_length = 64
batch_size = 512
dim = 768

generate_dpr_embeddings(init_file, num_of_files, num_embd, doc_stride, max_length, dim,
                        batch_size,
                        dataset_dir, fname_prefix_out, cache_folder)
```
3. **Generate the ground-truth** by conducting an exhaustive search with the inner product metric. 
   We provide the [ground-truth](gtruth_dpr10M_innerProduct.ivecs) for the dataset generated using 
   [dpr_dataset_10M.py](dpr_dataset_10M.py).
   
> **_NOTE:_**  Due to floating-point arithmetic precision the vector embeddings generated using the provided
> code in different machines may slightly vary. Keep in mind that this could cause small discrepancies with the provided ground-truth.  

4. Functions `read_fvecs` and `read_ivecs` can be used to read `.fvecs` and `.ivecs` files respectively.
